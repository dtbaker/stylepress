== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this compatible with my theme? =

Maybe. Try it out. Tick the "Remove Theme CSS" option in StylePress > Settings. Let me know if you have any troubles.

Try to install the Easy Google Fonts plugin. This gives some great global font style features in Appearance > Customize.
Go into the Elementor > Settings window and disable the default Elementor fonts and color
